Sketch a proof that the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) support is anti-monotone, i.e., the support of a pattern $P'$ is no larger than _any_ pattern $P$ included in $P'$ (that is, $P$ is a sub-pattern of $P'$). To guide you into the proof, start from a set of matchings of the pattern $P'$ which corresponds to an independent set of nodes $I'$ in the overlap graph $G'_{O}$, same for the set of nodes $I$ in the overlap graph $G_O$ of $P$. Observe (_Observation 1_) that the **all** the matchings $f'$ of $P'$ contain matchings $f$ of $P$. Also observe (_Observation 2_) that if you take two matchings $f_1'$ and $f_2'$ of $P'$ and the corresponding matchings $f_1$ and $f_2$ of $P$ overlap, so will the matchings $f_1'$ and $f_2'$. Given these two observation what can you deduce on the independent sets $I'$ of $G'_O$ and $I$ of $G_O$?"

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Err(j+1, i)$ is the error of a segment that contains items from $j+1$ to $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. What is the default space-complexity of this algorithm?\n",
    "2. If we are willing to recompute some tabulated results, can we then reduce the \n",
    "    default space-complexity? _Exactly how_? What is the space-complexity then?\n",
    "3. What is the cost of using the above space-efficiency technique in terms of time-complexity?\n",
    "4. For the sub-problem of segmenting the $i$-prefix of sequence $S$ into $b$ segments, consider \n",
    "    the segment $M(i, b)$ that contains (if such segment exists) the middle item of \n",
